# Later App

!!! This project is still under development !!!   

!!! ONLY TESTED ON ANDROID !!!

Later App is basically a YouTube Watch-Later list, but for websites and URLs:
- If you have a website you want to look into later, not now, then just share the website into the Later App.
- Add a title, and done!. 
- URLs can be added manually as well. 
- The URLs are stored as tiles, and clicking on the icon on the left side takes you to the corresponding website using the default browser of your device.
- The URLs and related data are stored locally in your device. 
- When done using the URL, delete it using the delete button on the right. 

Technologies Used: 
- Flutter and Dart for making the app. 
- SQLite SQL database for storing the data. Implemented through SQFLite flutter package. 
- Intents handled using receive_sharing_intent package for flutter. 
- URL and their launching handled by url_launcher flutter package.
- Used Material Design principles for designing the app. 
- Used Google fonts for the UI.
